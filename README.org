​* = LinuxED assumes that flatpak/snap Discord installs are in [[https://github.com/Cr3atable/LinuxED/blob/master/LinuxED.py#L54-L55][preset directories]] (which works /most/ of the time), ezed [[https://github.com/erebid/ezed/blob/master/ezed#L128-L140][makes use of Flatpak/Snap commands]] to find the correct location before falling back to a default location.
** Goals
- Have correct, readable code ([[https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck][ShellCheck]] compliance, and following standard convention.)
- Avoid the use of dependencies that wouldn't be found on most GNU/Linux distributions or MacOS systems (for maximum portability.)

** Non-goals
- Add Windows support (EnhancedDiscord has an [[https://github.com/joe27g/EnhancedDiscord#installing-the-easy-way][official installer]] for Windows)
