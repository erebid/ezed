Easy EnhancedDiscord installer.

Project is currently WIP, doesn't work at all (yet).

** Goals
- Have clean Code (through Shellcheck compliance and following common Bash conventions).
- Don't use dependencies that wouldn't be found on most GNU/Linux distributions or MacOS systems (for maximum portability).

** Non-goals
- Add Windows support (EnhancedDiscord has an official installer for Windows)
